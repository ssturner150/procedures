# Bond Procedures

####Cash Bond Refund Procedures

When a Defendant’s case is satisfied in court and the Defendant was released on a cash bond, the court processes the cash bond refunds within a few days. The funds are processed by the Bond Division at Municipal Court and the then forwarded and processed by the Accounts Payable Division of the City of Atlanta and sent via mail within 3 weeks. The checks are processed payable to the Surety on the bond at the address that is stated at the time the bond was posted. Any address changes must be done in person by the Surety at Atlanta Municipal Court 150 Garnett St, Atlanta, GA.-Bond Division-404-658-6915. A photo Id must be presented at the time of the address change. If you have not received your cash bond refund within 30 days please contact the Bond Division.

In the event that your case has been bound over to a higher court the cash bond funds are sent with the case to that court and you will have to contact that court division for any refunds or address changes.

####Fines Paid with Cash Bond Funds

A cash bond may be used to pay a fine imposed by the court with the bond Surety’s approval. This can be authorized by the Surety appearing with the Defendant with a photo ID on the 2nd floor Bond Division. This can also be completed prior to the court date with the bond Surety authorizing the fines to be paid from the cash bond. A power of attorney can be used along with a copy of a photo ID filed with the court to allow the fines to be paid without the Surety’s appearance. Any remaining funds will be mailed to the Surety. 

####Fail to Appear-Bond Forfeiture

If you missed your court date for either a criminal or traffic citation, you are in failure to appear status and if you are out on a bond release you must first contact the bond company with whom you were released in order for them to process a letter to the court with regards to if they are willing to remain on your bond. 

In the event of a missed court appearance on a cash bond release the bond is forfeited at the end of the missed court session. These funds are forfeited and collected by the court and the case will remain in fail to appear status.
